		<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the
		Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the
		Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
		ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number
		of countries in Africa.</p>

			<p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
		University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
		dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid
		horns and frills.</p>

			<p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
		History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New
		York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
		accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
		and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
		interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of
		Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>

			<p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
		work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
		also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book,
		Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most
		comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
